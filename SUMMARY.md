# 🚀 Volli Project Setup Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Analysis
- Analyzed the original README.md requirements
- Understood the vision for a post-quantum secure, local-first messaging platform
- Identified key technical requirements and constraints

### 2. Architecture Design
- Created comprehensive system architecture documentation
- Designed component interactions and data flows
- Defined security architecture with post-quantum cryptography
- Planned for multi-platform deployment (Web, Mobile, Desktop)

### 3. Implementation Roadmap
- Developed detailed 12-week sprint plan
- Defined clear milestones and deliverables
- Included risk mitigation strategies
- Set performance and quality metrics

### 4. Project Structure
- Set up monorepo with Turborepo for efficient builds
- Created package structure for modular development
- Configured TypeScript for type safety
- Established clear separation of concerns

### 5. Core Packages Initialized
- **@volli/identity-core**: Post-quantum crypto and identity management
- **@volli/vault-core**: Encrypted local storage with CRDT support
- **@volli/messaging**: Message handling and encryption
- **@volli/ui-kit**: Shared Svelte UI components
- **apps/web**: SvelteKit web application

### 6. Documentation Created
- **docs/OVERVIEW.md**: Project introduction and navigation
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**: Detailed system design
- **docs/SECURITY.md**: Comprehensive security guide
- **docs/DEVELOPER.md**: Development setup and workflow
- **docs/ROADMAP.md**: Implementation timeline

### 7. Development Environment
- Configured build tools (Turbo, TypeScript, Vite)
- Set up testing framework (Vitest)
- Added linting and formatting tools
- Created .gitignore for proper version control

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build all packages: `npm run build`
3. Start development: `npm run dev`

### Development Priorities (Week 1-2)
1. Implement post-quantum crypto in @volli/identity-core
2. Set up encrypted SQLite storage in @volli/vault-core
3. Create basic UI components in @volli/ui-kit
4. Build initial web app shell

### Key Decisions Made
- **Monorepo**: Better code sharing and dependency management
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire codebase
- **SvelteKit**: Modern, performant web framework
- **Turborepo**: Efficient build orchestration
- **Post-Quantum First**: Security as the foundation
