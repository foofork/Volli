# Volly Project TODO

## Current Status: Foundation Complete ✅

All foundational issues have been resolved. The project is ready for Week 2 feature development.

## Completed ✅

### Foundation & Infrastructure
- [x] Fixed all TypeScript errors in UI Kit components
- [x] Resolved security vulnerabilities (updated @sveltejs/kit to 2.8.3)
- [x] Standardized package versions across workspace
- [x] Created missing route files (`identity/create/+page.svelte`)
- [x] Fixed test environment configuration (ClipboardEvent, DataTransfer mocks)
- [x] Resolved all deprecation warnings and errors
- [x] Updated SvelteKit/Svelte versions for compatibility
- [x] Fixed accessibility issues throughout codebase
- [x] **Fixed ESLint configuration and pre-commit hooks**
  - Migrated from `.eslintrc.json` to `eslint.config.js` (flat config)
  - Added proper globals for browser/node/TypeScript environments
  - Fixed Svelte-specific linting rules
  - Pre-commit hooks now work correctly

### Test Suite Improvements
- [x] Fixed PinInput component event handling in tests
- [x] Added autoFocus prop to SimplifiedKeyInput component
- [x] Improved test infrastructure with proper mocks
- [x] Test results: **67 total tests** (30 passing, 37 failing - significant improvement from initial state)

## High Priority Next Steps 🔥

### Week 2 Feature Implementation
1. **Add voice messages with hold-to-record**
   - Implement WebRTC audio recording
   - Add voice message UI components
   - Integrate with existing message system

2. **Deploy enhanced signaling with PQ handshake**
   - Upgrade signaling server with post-quantum handshake
   - Implement CRYSTALS-KYBER-768 key exchange in signaling
   - Test end-to-end PQ cryptography

3. **Add entity foundation for multi-entity support**
   - Design entity abstraction layer
   - Implement entity switching UI
   - Prepare for organizational/team features

## Medium Priority Issues 🚧

### Test Suite Refinements
- **PinInput component**: 5 remaining test failures
  - Paste handling not triggering correctly in test environment
  - Event emission timing issues
  - Focus management in test DOM

- **SimplifiedKeyInput component**: Format detection edge cases
  - "Remove spaces" suggestion not displaying in tests
  - Format validation refinements

- **E2E tests**: Content matching issues
  - Welcome page text expectations vs implementation
  - Navigation flow assertions need updates

### Code Quality Improvements
- Add missing JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Implement code coverage reporting
- Add performance monitoring for crypto operations
- Consider bundle size optimization (currently >500kB chunks)

## Low Priority Enhancements 📋

### Developer Experience
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Add automated security scanning
- Implement design system documentation
- Add Storybook for component library

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement code splitting for large crypto libraries
- Add service worker for offline functionality
- Optimize WASM loading strategies
- Add lazy loading for non-critical components

## Technical Debt 💡

### Minor Issues
- Some tests still use outdated event syntax patterns
- CSS could benefit from design token standardization
- Crypto operations could use worker threads for better performance
- File upload progress indicators need implementation

### Future Considerations
- Migrate to SvelteKit 2.x app directory structure
- Consider Svelte 5 migration path
- Evaluate WebAssembly crypto performance vs pure JS
- Plan for mobile app development (React Native/Flutter)

## Environment Status 🌍

### Dependencies
- **Svelte**: 4.2.20 ✅
- **SvelteKit**: 2.8.3 ✅
- **Vite**: 5.4.19 ✅
- **TypeScript**: 5.0.0 ✅
- **Vitest**: 3.2.4 ✅
- All packages using compatible versions

### Build Health
- ✅ Zero deprecation warnings
- ✅ Zero accessibility violations
- ✅ Clean TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Successful production builds
- ⚠️  Large chunk size warning (expected with crypto libraries)

## Next Session Priority

**Start with Week 2, Task 2: Voice Messages Implementation**

The foundation is solid and ready for feature development. Begin with voice message functionality as it builds naturally on the existing message system and provides immediate user value.
