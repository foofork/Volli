## 🎯 Current Status & Next Steps

### ✅ Phase 0: Integration (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Added persistent storage (IndexedDB with Dexie)
- ✅ Connected all packages to web app
- ✅ Implemented real encryption (libsodium)
- ✅ Complete vault management system
- ✅ Full messaging with persistence
- ✅ Contact management with validation

### ✅ Phase 1: Network Layer (COMPLETE - January 2025)
- ✅ Implement P2P messaging (WebRTC with data channels)
- ✅ Message queue with persistence and retry logic
- ✅ Real-time message sync via data channels
- ✅ Per-recipient message encryption
- ✅ Network status monitoring (online/offline)
- ✅ Peer connection management with STUN servers

### 🚧 Phase 2: Advanced Features (Next)
- [ ] Add CRDT for conflict resolution
- [ ] File sharing and synchronization
- [ ] Multi-device sync
- [ ] Signaling server for peer discovery
- [ ] NAT traversal with TURN servers

---

## 🟢 Newly Implemented Features (January 2025)

### Network & P2P
- ✅ WebRTC peer connections with data channels
- ✅ `getSyncEndpoint()` fully implemented
- ✅ Real-time message delivery over network
- ✅ Network status monitoring (online/offline)
- ✅ STUN server configuration for NAT traversal

### Encryption & Security
- ✅ Per-recipient message encryption (`encryptForRecipient()`)
- ✅ Public key storage and retrieval for contacts
- ✅ Key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) for secure key exchange
- ✅ Encrypted message storage with recipient-specific versions

### Message Queue
- ✅ Async `getPending()` with proper Promise interface
- ✅ Full queue persistence in IndexedDB
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 5s, 15s, 1m)
- ✅ Delivery tracking with `markDelivered()` and `markFailed()`

### Contact Management
- ✅ Contact search issues resolved
- ✅ Unique publicKey enforcement for contacts

## 🔴 Remaining Gaps

### Advanced Features
- ❌ CRDT for conflict resolution
- ❌ Cross-device sync (requires signaling server)
- ❌ File encryption on disk (currently in memory only)
- ❌ TURN servers for complex NAT scenarios
- ❌ Peer discovery without manual connection

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/foofork/Volli.git
cd Volli
npm install

# Build packages
npm run build:packages

# Run web app (local functionality only)
cd apps/web && npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Not for production use** - Alpha software
2. **P2P messaging functional** - WebRTC data channels for real-time communication
3. **Per-recipient encryption working** - Messages encrypted for specific recipients
4. **Manual peer connection required** - No automatic peer discovery yet
5. **File storage in memory** - Files not encrypted on disk
6. **No signaling server** - Peers must exchange connection info manually

## 🌐 P2P Implementation Details

### WebRTC Architecture
```javascript
// Network Store Features
- Peer connection management
- Data channel setup and monitoring
- Online/offline status tracking
- Message queuing for offline peers
- Automatic reconnection attempts
```

### Message Flow
1. **Send**: Message → Encrypt for recipient → Queue if offline → Send via data channel
2. **Receive**: Data channel → Decrypt message → Store locally → Update UI
3. **Retry**: Failed messages → Exponential backoff → Max 4 attempts → Store for manual retry

### Connection Setup (Manual)
```javascript
// Peer A: Create offer
const offer = await networkStore.connectToPeer(peerId);
// Send offer to Peer B via external channel

// Peer B: Accept offer
await networkStore.connectToPeer(peerId, offer);
// Send answer back to Peer A

// Both peers now connected via data channel
```
