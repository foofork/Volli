# Feature Simplification Strategy

## Core Philosophy: Hide the How, Show the What

Users care about **what** they can do, not **how** it works. Every feature should be presented in terms of user benefit, not technical capability.

## Feature Transformation Map

### 🔐 Security Features

| Current Technical Feature | Simplified User Feature | Hidden Complexity |
|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption | "Your chats are private" | All encryption happens automatically |
| Ed25519/X25519 keypairs | "Your secure identity" | Generated invisibly during setup |
| Argon2id KDF | "PIN protection" | Complexity hidden behind simple 6-digit PIN |
| Encrypted IndexedDB vault | "Your messages" | Just shows chat history |
| Per-recipient encryption | "End-to-end encrypted" | Simple lock icon |

### 🌐 Networking Features

| Current Technical Feature | Simplified User Feature | Hidden Complexity |
|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| WebRTC DataChannels | "Direct messaging" | Connection handling automatic |
| Signaling server | "Online status" | Shows as green/yellow/red dot |
| NAT traversal | "Works everywhere" | Automatic fallbacks |
| Offline message queuing | "Send anytime" | Queue indicator when offline |
| P2P discovery | "Find friends" | Happens behind simple search |

### 🎛️ Adaptive Trust System

| Current Technical Feature | Simplified User Feature | Hidden Complexity |
|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Trust metrics calculation | Contact badges (🟢🟡🔴) | Algorithm runs silently |
| Connection mode selection | "Connection quality" | Auto-selects best mode |
| Go Dark mode | "Airplane mode" toggle | Complex P2P routing hidden |
| Network topology analysis | "Finding best route..." | Brief loading message |
| Trust rule engine | Smart notifications | "Alice is using a new device" |

## Simplification Principles

### 1. **Automatic Everything**
```javascript
// OLD: User chooses connection mode
connectionMode: 'direct' | 'relay' | 'hybrid'

// NEW: Automatic selection
connectionStatus: 'connected' | 'connecting' | 'offline'
```

### 2. **Visual Over Textual**
```
OLD: "Connection: WebRTC DataChannel over TURN relay"
NEW: 🟡 (yellow dot = connecting through relay)
```

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
```
Main View: "Sarah ✓✓"
Tap for details: "Delivered · Read 2:30pm"
Long press: "Encrypted · Direct connection"
Settings > Advanced: Full technical details
```

### 4. **Smart Defaults**
- Auto-reconnect without user intervention
- Best encryption selected automatically
- Optimal routes chosen silently
- Battery-efficient modes when on mobile

## Feature Bundles
