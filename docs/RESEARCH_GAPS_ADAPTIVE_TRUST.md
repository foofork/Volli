# Research Gaps for Adaptive Trust System

## Overview
This document identifies areas requiring additional research before implementation of the adaptive trust system.

## 1. Context Detection Algorithms

### Gap: Network Trust Classification
**Question**: How do we reliably determine if a network is "trusted" vs "hostile"?

**Research Needed**:
- Fingerprinting techniques for network identification
- Statistical models for anomaly detection
- Privacy-preserving network analysis methods

**Existing Research to Review**:
- Android's Network Scorer API
- iOS Network Extension framework
- Academic papers on network fingerprinting

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Must work without sending data to servers
- Should detect VPN/Tor without breaking them
- Need to handle spoofing attempts

### Gap: Content Sensitivity Detection
**Question**: How do we detect sensitive content without analyzing message content?

**Research Needed**:
- Behavioral patterns indicating sensitivity
- Metadata analysis techniques
- User interaction patterns

**Potential Approaches**:
- Time-of-day patterns
- Message frequency changes
- File type indicators
- Conversation participant analysis

## 2. Rule Conflict Resolution

### Gap: Deterministic Conflict Resolution
**Question**: When user rules conflict, how do we resolve them predictably?

**Research Needed**:
- Rule priority systems
- Conflict detection algorithms
- User-friendly conflict visualization

**Examples to Solve**:
```
Rule 1: "Always use Private mode on public WiFi"
Rule 2: "Always use Fast mode with Mom"
Conflict: Talking to Mom on public WiFi
```

**Potential Solutions**:
- Explicit priority ordering
- Most-specific-wins strategy
- User prompt for ambiguous cases
- Rule combination strategies

## 3. Performance Optimization

### Gap: Battery-Efficient Discovery
**Question**: How do we run multiple discovery methods without draining battery?

**Research Needed**:
- Adaptive polling intervals
- Wake lock optimization
- Background task scheduling
- Network request batching

**Metrics to Define**:
- Acceptable battery impact (< 5%?)
- Discovery latency targets
- Background vs foreground behavior

### Gap: Connection Upgrade Timing
**Question**: When is the optimal time to upgrade a connection?

**Research Needed**:
- User activity prediction
- Network condition forecasting
- Message pattern analysis

**Factors to Consider**:
- User's typing patterns
- Historical conversation length
- Time of day
- Battery level thresholds

## 4. User Interface Patterns

### Gap: Trust Visualization Language
**Question**: How do we show security states without technical jargon or fear?

**Research Needed**:
- Icon effectiveness studies
- Color psychology for security
- Animation patterns for transitions
- Cultural differences in security perception

**Test Scenarios**:
- First-time user understanding
- Mode transition comprehension
- Error state communication
- Upgrade prompts

### Gap: Rule Builder Interface
**Question**: How do non-technical users create complex rules?

**Research Needed**:

**Question**: How does the system learn user preferences without creating a profile?

**Research Needed**:
- Differential privacy techniques
- Federated learning approaches
- Statistical modeling without storage
- Forgetting mechanisms

**Requirements**:
- No persistent user profiles
- Adaptations must be explainable
- User can reset learning

## 6. Protocol Negotiation

### Gap: Efficient Capability Exchange
**Question**: How do peers agree on connection methods without leaking capabilities?

**Research Needed**:
- Private set intersection protocols
- Capability advertisement strategies
- Version negotiation patterns
- Downgrade attack prevention

**Security Considerations**:
- Don't reveal all capabilities to untrusted peers
- Prevent capability probing attacks
- Handle version mismatches gracefully

## 7. Existing Solutions Analysis

### Systems to Study in Depth:

**Briar**
- Bluetooth and Tor-based P2P
- How do they handle mode switching?

   - Test with 1000+ rules
   - Measure memory usage

3. **UI Comprehension Study**
   - Test trust indicators with 20 users
   - Measure understanding rates
   - Iterate on confusing elements

4. **Battery Impact Testing**
   - Run all discovery methods for 24 hours
   - Measure actual battery drain
   - Identify optimization opportunities

## 10. Open Questions

1. **Should adaptive mode be opt-in or opt-out?**
   - Privacy implications of each
   - User expectation studies needed

2. **How many trust levels are optimal?**
   - Current proposal has 4
   - Is this too many? Too few?

3. **What's the right default mode?**
   - Balanced seems logical
   - But varies by user type

4. **How do we handle group chats?**
   - Lowest common denominator?
   - Per-participant modes?

5. **What about backwards compatibility?**
