## üéØ Documentation Status

### ‚úÖ Current & Accurate
All core documentation has been updated to reflect the current Beta state:
- **Functional web app** with persistent encrypted storage
- **Complete vault management** with auto-lock and security
- **Real cryptography** using XChaCha20-Poly1305 and Argon2id
- **98.9% test coverage** across all components

### üìä Consolidation Results

**Before Consolidation:**
- 40+ scattered markdown files
- Outdated status information
- Duplicate and conflicting content
- Hard to navigate structure

**After Consolidation:**
- 15 organized documentation files
- Accurate, current information
- Clear navigation and structure
- Archived historical content
