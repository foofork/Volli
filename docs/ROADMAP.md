## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1-2 Full-stack developers
- 1 Security engineer (part-time)
- 1 Mobile developer (Phase 3)

### Infrastructure
- Development servers for relay testing
- CI/CD pipeline for multi-platform builds
- Security audit budget ($15-30k)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Sprint 0.1 - Web App Persistence
2. **Week 1**: Set up IndexedDB integration
3. **Week 2**: Replace mock stores with real implementations
4. **Week 3**: Security review of persistence layer
5. **Week 4**: Begin real crypto integration

This roadmap reflects the actual current state and provides a realistic path forward.
