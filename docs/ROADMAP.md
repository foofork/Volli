   - Peer connection lifecycle management
   - Data channel setup and monitoring
   - Online/offline status tracking
   - Message delivery with queuing

2. **Message Queue** (`packages/integration/src/message-queue.ts`)
   - Async operations with Promises
   - Exponential backoff retry (1s ‚Üí 5s ‚Üí 15s ‚Üí 1m)
   - Persistent storage across sessions
   - Delivery tracking and failure handling

3. **Recipient Encryption** (`packages/integration/src/messaging.ts`)
   - `encryptForRecipient()` using key encapsulation
   - Per-recipient encrypted message versions
   - Public key management for contacts

### Usage Example
```javascript
// Connect to peer
await networkStore.connectToPeer(peerId, offer);

// Messages automatically sync via data channels
// Failed messages retry with exponential backoff
// Queue persists across app restarts
```
