# Volli Launch Strategy - From Demo to Product

## Current State (January 2025)

### What's Built ✅
- Encrypted P2P messaging works
- Web app fully functional  
- Messages persist and sync
- Security implemented

### What's Blocking Launch ❌
1. **Can't find other users** (no discovery)
2. **No mobile apps** (web-only = niche)
3. **No push notifications** (messages missed)

## Technical Priorities

### Must Have for Launch
1. ✅ Encrypted messaging (DONE)
2. ✅ Message persistence (DONE)
3. ⏳ User discovery (Week 1-3)
4. ⏳ Mobile apps (Week 1-4)
5. ⏳ Push notifications (Week 2)

### Can Add Post-Launch
- Desktop apps
- Federation
- P2P discovery
- Post-quantum crypto
- Adaptive trust

## Resource Requirements

### Minimum Team (4 people)
1. **Backend Dev**: Signaling server, infrastructure
2. **Mobile Dev**: Capacitor apps, native features
3. **Designer**: App store assets, UI polish
4. **Marketing**: Launch coordination, community

### Ideal Team (6-8 people)
- +1 Backend (federation, scaling)
- +1 Frontend (web app improvements)
- +1 QA (cross-platform testing)
- +1 DevOps (reliability, monitoring)

## Budget

### Essential ($3,000)
- Servers: $50/month × 6 months = $300
- Apple Developer: $99/year
- Google Play: $25
- Code signing: $500/year
- Domains/SSL: $100/year
- Buffer: $2,000

### Recommended ($10,000)
- Professional design: $2,000
- Security audit: $3,000
- Marketing/PR: $2,000
- Additional infrastructure: $3,000

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **App Store Rejection**
   - Mitigation: Follow guidelines strictly
   - Backup: Progressive Web App

2. **Signaling Server Overload**
   - Mitigation: Start small, scale gradually
   - Backup: Multiple server regions

3. **Security Issues**
   - Mitigation: Security review before launch
   - Backup: Rapid patch process

### Market Risks
1. **Low Adoption**
   - Mitigation: Strong privacy narrative
   - Backup: Open source community

2. **Competitor Response**
   - Mitigation: Unique features (post-quantum)
   - Backup: Faster innovation

## Go/No-Go Criteria

### Soft Launch (Week 4)
- [ ] Signaling server: 99.9% uptime for 48 hours
- [ ] Mobile apps: Approved in both stores
- [ ] Connection success: > 95%
- [ ] No critical security issues

### Public Launch (Week 8)
- [ ] 100+ beta users happy
- [ ] < 1% crash rate
- [ ] 4.0+ app store rating
- [ ] Press kit ready
- [ ] Support documentation complete

## Action Items

### This Week
1. Start signaling server development
2. Setup Capacitor project
3. Create app store accounts
4. Design app icons/screenshots

### Next Week
1. Signaling server alpha testing
2. Push notification integration
3. TestFlight/Beta setup
4. Security review prep

## The Bottom Line

**Without signaling and mobile apps, Volli is a technical demo.**
**With them, it's a product people can actually use.**

Focus on shipping these two features. Everything else can wait.

Target: **Soft launch in 4 weeks, public launch in 8 weeks.**
