## Key Concepts

### Connection-Based Trust Model (Current)
Visual indicators for connection security:
- üü£ **Purple** - Direct P2P connection (highest privacy)
- üîµ **Blue** - Server-assisted connection (encrypted routing)
- üü† **Orange** - Unverified source (caution required)

Key Features:
- **"Go Dark"** - Transition from server to P2P as trust builds
- **Connection Memory** - System learns preferred connection methods
- **Progressive Trust** - Relationships evolve from public to private

### Environment-Based Trust Model (Alternative)
- ‚òï **Convenience** - Fast, minimal privacy
- üõ°Ô∏è **Balanced** - Good privacy/performance balance  
- üè∞ **Private** - Maximum privacy
- üîí **Air Gap** - Local only, no internet

### Core Principles
1. **User Sovereignty** - User rules always win
2. **Performance First** - < 5% battery/CPU
3. **Privacy by Design** - No user profiling
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Don't break existing functionality

## Implementation Status

- ‚úÖ Research complete
- ‚úÖ Architecture designed
- ‚úÖ API contracts defined
- üöß Ready for TDD implementation

## For Implementers

Start with the [Implementation Guide](./ADAPTIVE_TRUST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) and keep the [Quick Reference](./ADAPTIVE_TRUST_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) open while coding.

All development must follow [TDD methodology](./ADAPTIVE_TRUST_TDD_GUIDE.md):
