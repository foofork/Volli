## Key Concepts

### Trust Modes
- ☕ **Convenience** - Fast, minimal privacy
- 🛡️ **Balanced** - Good privacy/performance balance  
- 🏰 **Private** - Maximum privacy
- 🔒 **Air Gap** - Local only, no internet

### Core Principles
1. **User Sovereignty** - User rules always win
2. **Performance First** - < 5% battery/CPU
3. **Privacy by Design** - No user profiling
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Don't break existing functionality

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Research complete
- ✅ Architecture designed
- ✅ API contracts defined
- 🚧 Ready for TDD implementation

## For Implementers

Start with the [Implementation Guide](./ADAPTIVE_TRUST_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) and keep the [Quick Reference](./ADAPTIVE_TRUST_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) open while coding.

All development must follow [TDD methodology](./ADAPTIVE_TRUST_TDD_GUIDE.md):
