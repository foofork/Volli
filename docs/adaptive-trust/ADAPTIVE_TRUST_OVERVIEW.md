# Adaptive Trust System - Overview

## What is Adaptive Trust?

Volli's Adaptive Trust System intelligently balances privacy and performance based on context, while giving users absolute control through sovereignty rules.

**Core Innovation**: Users don't have to choose between privacy and convenience - the system adapts intelligently while respecting user rules.

## Key Principles

1. **User Sovereignty**: User rules ALWAYS override system suggestions
2. **Performance First**: < 5% battery/CPU, < 200MB memory
3. **Privacy by Design**: No profiles, local processing only
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Enhances but doesn't break existing Volli

## Trust Modes

| Mode | Icon | Use Case | Performance |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Convenience** | ☕ | Casual chats, trusted networks | Fastest, < 2% battery |
| **Balanced** | 🛡️ | Daily communication | Good, < 4% battery |
| **Private** | 🏰 | Sensitive content | Secure, < 6% battery |
| **Air Gap** | 🔒 | Maximum security | Local only, minimal battery |

## How It Works

```
User Context → Trust Decision → Connection Strategy → Secure Communication
     ↑              ↓
User Rules ←─── Sovereignty ──→ Adaptive Learning (session only)
```
