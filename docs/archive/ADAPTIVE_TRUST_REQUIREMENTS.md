# Adaptive Trust System Requirements Capture

## Core Vision
Create a messaging system where users maintain absolute sovereignty over their security posture while benefiting from intelligent adaptive suggestions that make privacy convenient.

## Part 1: Proven Patterns We Can Borrow

### From Signal Protocol
- **Double Ratchet Algorithm** ✓ Already implemented
- **Prekeys for async messaging** ✓ Already implemented
- **End-to-end encryption** ✓ Already implemented
- **Sealed sender** → Can adapt for metadata protection

### From Tor Network
- **Onion routing patterns** → For high-privacy mode
- **Bridge concepts** → For censorship circumvention
- **Consensus mechanisms** → For distributed trust

### From BitTorrent/DHT
- **Kademlia DHT** → For decentralized discovery
- **Magnet links** → For connection bootstrapping
- **Peer exchange (PEX)** → For finding mutual contacts
- **Tracker protocols** → For optional rendezvous servers

### From Matrix/XMPP
- **Federation patterns** → For server interoperability
- **Room state resolution** → Can adapt for group chats
- **Capability negotiation** → For feature discovery

### From SimpleX
- **Queue-based async messaging** → For serverless message relay
- **No persistent identifiers** → For anonymity mode
- **Connection links** → For invite system

### From Session
- **Onion routing for messages** → For metadata protection
- **Service nodes** → For decentralized infrastructure

### From UI/UX Best Practices
- **Progressive disclosure** → From simple to advanced
- **Traffic light systems** → For security indicators
- **Mode switching** (like iOS Focus modes) → For context switching
- **Privacy labels** (like Apple's) → For transparency

## Part 2: What We Need to Build New

### 1. Adaptive Context Engine
**New Component**: Real-time context detection and analysis
```typescript
interface ContextEngine {
  // Novel: Combines multiple signals for intelligent decisions
  detectNetworkTrust(): NetworkTrustLevel;
  detectDeviceRisk(): DeviceRiskProfile;
  detectContentSensitivity(): SensitivityScore;
  detectUserIntent(): IntentProfile;
}
```

### 2. User Sovereignty Rules Engine
**New Component**: Declarative rule system with conflict resolution
```typescript
interface RulesEngine {
  // Novel: User rules as first-class citizens
  mandatoryRules: Rule[];  // Cannot be overridden
  preferences: Preference[];  // Can be overridden
  allowAdaptive: boolean;  // Consent for automation
  conflictResolution: ConflictStrategy;
}
```

### 3. Transparent Mode Orchestrator
**New Component**: Seamless switching between connection strategies
```typescript
interface ModeOrchestrator {
  // Novel: Maintains connection during mode switches
  currentMode: TrustMode;
  activeStrategies: Strategy[];
  pendingUpgrades: UpgradeQueue;
  seamlessTransition(from: Mode, to: Mode): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 4. Trust Certainty Display
**New Component**: Clear visualization of security state and reasoning
```typescript
interface TrustCertaintyUI {
  // Novel: Shows WHY not just WHAT
  currentState: SecurityState;
  reasoning: DecisionPath;
  userOverrides: Override[];
  auditTrail: Decision[];
}
```

### 5. Hybrid Discovery Protocol
**New Component**: Unified protocol supporting multiple discovery methods
```typescript
interface HybridDiscovery {
  // Novel: Single API for multiple methods
  strategies: DiscoveryStrategy[];
  negotiate(peer: PeerId): OptimalPath;
  fallbackChain: Strategy[];
  upgradeHints: UpgradePath[];
}
```
